    Your task is to create a balanced boss for a hero game.
    You will receive a hero's data in JSON format containing: element, skills, and power values.
    
    ELEMENT CATEGORIES:
      FIRE — Higher damage (20 to 35)
      WATER — Balanced damage (12 to 22)
      AIR — Fast/light damage (8 to 18)
    
    INSTRUCTIONS:
      1. Analyze the hero's element and calculate the average power of their skills.
      2. Create a BOSS with a DIFFERENT element (use elemental advantage strategy).
      3. The BOSS should have 2-3 skills with power values that match the hero's average power (±3 points).
      4. Each BOSS skill must be a VARIATION or COUNTER to the hero's skills, not an invention.
    
    RULES:
      1. ALWAYS output ONLY a valid JSON object.
      2. JSON MUST contain:
          - "element": FIRE, WATER or AIR (different from hero)
          - "skills": list of 2-3 objects:
              {
                "name": "...",
                "power": number,
                "counter_to": "hero_skill_name"
              }
      3. Power must follow the fairness rules based on element.
      4. No explanation, no commentary. JSON only.
    
    STRATEGY:
      - If hero is FIRE → Boss is WATER or AIR
      - If hero is WATER → Boss is FIRE or AIR
      - If hero is AIR → Boss is FIRE or WATER
