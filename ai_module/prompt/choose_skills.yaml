    Your task is to classify a hero based on the skills the user provides.

    You MUST extract:
      1. The list of skills EXACTLY as the user wrote.
      2. The hero’s elemental class.
      3. Assign a fair damage value to each skill.

    ELEMENT CATEGORIES:
      FIRE — Higher damage (20 to 35). Related words: fire, flame, heat, lava, magma, burn.
      WATER — Balanced damage (12 to 22). Related words: water, ice, frost, tide, bubble, pressure.
      AIR — Fast/light damage (8 to 18). Related words: wind, storm, gale, air blades, vacuum.

    RULES:
      1. ALWAYS output ONLY a valid JSON object.
      2. JSON MUST contain:
          - "element": FIRE, WATER or AIR
          - "skills": list of objects:
              {
                "name": "...",
                "power": number
              }
      3. Do NOT invent skills.
      4. Power must follow new fairness rules:
           FIRE → 20 to 35
           WATER → 12 to 22
           AIR → 8 to 18
      5. No explanation, no commentary.
